    As I was finishing school with a BSc in physics, I was launching my first
    product while also launching its company: a video game studio founded in my
    friend's basement - no kidding. And at some point, while being distracted
    from MSc program interviews by the excitement (and terror) of launch, I got
    hooked on making things people use and love.


    I haven't looked back.


    Since then I've built startups, spoken at universities and conferences, and worked with some amazing teams of engineers, designers, artists and data scientists to build products people really value.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
